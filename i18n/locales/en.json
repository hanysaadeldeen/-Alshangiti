Among them, too, are procedural ones, such as issuing the necessary licenses and records to ensure the establishment and operation of commercial facilities legally.

        "Litigation and arbitration services involve legal representation provided to individuals and companies to resolve disputes efficiently and effectively. This includes advocacy before courts of all types and levels, as well as comprehensive support in arbitration proceedings before specialised tribunals and institutions.",
        "Under the right granted to us by the Saudi Code of Law Practice, we have worked since our first year on accumulated applications in the Saudi market. This enhanced our legal skills in the field of litigation services, and enabled us to successfully manage and settle many disputes. Therefore, we at Alshangiti & Associates Law Firm aim to employ our experience to support our clients by litigating before courts, quasi-judicial bodies, arbitration centers and bodies.",
        "Litigation before the Saudi judiciary requires the lawyer to be able to master both the formal and substantive aspects due to its exceptional nature. The major documents that were formulated, such as the judiciary law and system, carry rapid changes in this era due to the nature of the document’s texts. These texts are often conducted in restructuring the classification of cases and courts by splitting or merging, or forming new courts at all levels of first instance, appeal, and supreme courts. There are other complementary documents, namely principles, decisions, and rules issued by various judicial authorities, which may not be accessible to a non-specialist.",
        "One of the most common misconceptions, in understanding this role, is that litigation is assigned to a non-local service provider, who does not have the proper criteria for the selection, or to an unlicensed local one who is unfamiliar with the legislative and structural variables from outside or inside the commercial facility. Because there are many issues that may be extremely complicated from the point of view of who is unaware to the nature of the dispute, while the fact on the ground refers that processing such issues by us as a specialized service provider is different. Conversely, the approach may be formulated by simplifying what is complex and thorny. Therefore, we stress that the assignment decision is extremely important, and must be taken in the form of wise governance.",
        "Throughout our well-informed career in managing disputes and litigation processes, which we have developed as a printed knowledge product under the name of (Set of Rulings), and it includes all the cases in which we argue. It becomes, therefore. easy for any member of our team to access them as a reference, because each ruling, by its nature, includes the statement of claim and its written details. For example, the exchange of responses between both parties to the litigation in the same case, memorandums of defense, the legal grounds for the case and its executive regulations, the judges' reasoning on which the ruling was based, and statements of appeal, to name but a few. Accordingly, we believe that we are more reliable than other sources because we created such resources with our own hands.",
        "After more than 20 years of experience as a provider of dispute management services in the business sector, we have drawn a great similarity to the most local courts interrelated to this sector. Starting with the commercial, administrative, labor, human rights courts, passing through the administrative committees with the judicial jurisdiction, where the institutions operating in the sector may have to appear before them to protect or defend their activities, and reaching others.",
        "Furthermore, our efforts are not limited to managing the dispute before the court, but they include the alignment with the requirements of maintaining the relationship between the facility and its clients whenever possible by the professional mediation outside the court or by implementing or proposing settlements and analyzing their ease. Also, in the event that the dispute is settled by arbitration, we represent the facility, whether it was the claimant or the defendant, in accordance with the terms of the agreed arbitral award or through the compromises.",
        "We pay more attention to the quality of the defense strategy in its integrative form, as we carefully draw up and implement such then transfer it to our client realistically. We participate with the client in managing the case through the periodic reports on the development of the situation, as well as passing regulations, memoranda and requests before they are finally approved by the court, and we strive to keep the client's interest in their right with utmost effort at all stages of the case."
